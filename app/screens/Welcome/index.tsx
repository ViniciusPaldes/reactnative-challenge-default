              Welcome to <TextBold>"The Movie App"</TextBold> coding assessment!
              In this assessment, you'll be tasked with building a React Native
              application that showcases your skills in front-end development.
              You'll have the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to create
              a mobile application that fetches and displays movie data from an
              API, delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience. Let's
              dive in and showcase your React Native prowess!
